## Todo Web App

This project contains a simple TODO Application built using React + Vite.
This project uses localStorage to store and manage your todos so anyone can use it without signing up (Although I had implemented the backend for it XD).

It has the following features -

- Anyone can create a Todo.
- Anyone can see their existing Todos.
- Anyone can mark a Todo as done and see their progress.
- Todos can be updated.
